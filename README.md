# The Beinlich Wordlist of Ancient Egyptian

* http://egyptologyresources.x10host.com/er/beinlich/beinlich.html

> *What is the Beinlich wordlist?*
>
> The handlist of Ancient Egyptian words known to Egyptologists as the "Beinlich Wordlist" was announced by Horst Beinlich and Friedhelm Hoffmann in Göttinger Miszellen 140 (1994), 101-3. The raw data of the Wordlist is simply the Egyptian word in transliteration, a German translation, and brief references to the Wörterbuch or more recent publications. It is everyone's wish that the authors' hope of translations of the wordlist into other languages might come about.
>
> Beinlich and Hoffmann were from the start very keen to make the basic data file of the list available to colleagues, either by email or disc. My first involvement with this list was first to make it available over the Internet by FTP.
>
> The World Wide Web permits the consultation of databases online. It occurred to me in 1995 that the Beinlich wordlist might be an ideal candidate for such a database, and it has developed from there. The latest version permits searching by transcription, German translation, or reference (to pages primarily from the Wörterbuch or Année Lexicographique).
